# Overview

Bomb Racer is a game where you race a car on a track to reach a goal while avoiding all the bombs!

I have always wanted to make a 3D game, and this is my first one! It is a very simple game, but I am so glad that I had an opportunity to write this! I was inspired by Mario Kart, but it ended up as a vastly different game from Mario Kart. 

To play the game, use the WASD keys to control your car. The barriers will move out of the way when you hit them, but they're still a nuisance, so avoiding them is good. Definitely avoid the bombsâ€”there is a small chance they might send your car high into the sky, and you can't control where your car goes if it is not touching the ground.

# Development Environment

I used Unity and Visual Studio to write this game. It was programmed in C#. I used the EasyRoads3D and Road Architect extensions. I also used the "Stylized Grass Texture" by [LowlyPoly](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/16677).

* Add more levels and terrain with gradual increase in difficulty.
* Add high score board for each level, enable score saving.
* Enable resetting of score when continuing to the next level.
